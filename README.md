# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project
Hi everyone! This is my project on data cleaning as a step to my data analyst career. In this project, a rough dataset called layoffs is used in which the data is raw and cannot be used for visualization and more. So, the data is cleaned using MySQL. 
These steps are followed in this project.
                  => Remove Duplicates

                  
                  => Standardizing the Data

                  
                  => Looking for null or blank values

                  
                  => Remove unnecessary columns.
