# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project
Hi everyone! This is my project on data cleaning as a step to my data analyst career. In this project, a rough dataset called layoffs is used in which the data is raw and cannot be used for visualization and more. So, the data is cleaned using MySQL. 
These steps are followed in this project.
                 
                  
                  => Remove Duplicates

                  
                  => Standardizing the Data

                  
                  => Looking for null or blank values

                  
                  => Remove unnecessary columns.

After obtaiing the clean data of layoffs, Exploratory Data Analysis was done. 


                    => The laidoffs

                    
                    => When the laidoffs actually started in the companies 

                    
                    => The country of the companies 

                    
                    => The year of laidoffs

                    
                    => Laidoffs per month

                    
                    => Rolling total of the laidoffs with the substrings

The above are explored and analysed. Then I dealt with multiple Common Table Expressions(CTEs) to know the top laidoffs done by the companies from 2020 to 2023.
